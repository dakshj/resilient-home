"A gateway node needs to dynamically determine the failure of the other replica (this can be done
by any method that you choose such as exchanging "I am alive" heartbeat messages)"

Since we've build a Load Balancer, *that* is what is dynamically determining the live-status
of all gateways. Is that fine?
